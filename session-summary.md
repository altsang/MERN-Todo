# Session Summary

## Objective
The main goal for this session was to verify the CI/CD pipeline execution for the MERN-Todo application, ensuring successful deployment on AKS by testing CRUD operations through the browser interface. The specific task was to make UI changes to the application, such as changing the edit button from blue to green, committing the change, creating a pull request, and verifying that the CI/CD pipeline deploys the change successfully.

## Actions Taken

1. **CI/CD Pipeline Setup**
   - Set up a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions.
   - Managed pull requests and updated UI based on user feedback.

2. **UI Changes**
   - Changed the "Edit Todo" button's box color to green and the text link color back to white.
   - Committed the changes to the `feature/cicd-pipeline-setup` branch.
   - Created a pull request for the changes to be merged into the main branch.

3. **Verification of Deployment**
   - Monitored the CI/CD pipeline to ensure the new UI changes were deployed.
   - Verified the deployment by checking the application in the browser.
   - Took a screenshot to confirm the UI changes visually.

4. **Reporting**
   - Reported completion to the user with evidence of the successful deployment and UI changes.

## Tools and Resources Used
- GitHub Actions for CI/CD pipeline (`ci-cd-pipeline.yml`).
- GitHub PR for code review and merge (https://github.com/altsang/MERN-Todo/pull/14).
- AKS cluster and Azure resource group for deployment (MernTodoCluster, MernTodoResourceGroup).
- External IP for LoadBalancer (4.157.26.80) to access the deployed application.
- CSS classes `.edit-todo-button` and `.edit-link` for UI styling.
- Confirmed colors for UI elements (Green box, White text).

## Files Edited
- `frontend/src/index.css`: Updated styles for `.edit-link` and `.edit-todo-button`.
- `frontend/src/components/EditTodo.js`: Applied `.edit-todo-button` class to the "Edit Todo" button.

## Outcome
The session concluded with the successful implementation and verification of the requested UI changes. The "Edit Todo" button's box is green, and the text link is white, as confirmed by the screenshot and JavaScript command executed in the browser. The CI/CD pipeline has processed the changes, and the application is functioning with the new UI updates.

## Screenshot
- The screenshot confirming the "Edit Todo" button's appearance post-deployment is saved at `/home/ubuntu/screenshots/f317fee4-c268-400b-bdec-77a2b8395cc0.png`.
